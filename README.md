# TextDirect

Large number of people in several countries cannot avail GPS technologies due to 

- Lack of financial resources to purchase smartphones with GPS applications like Google Maps.
- Poor penetration of internet and mobile data services in the regions they reside in.

However, most have feature phones equipped with text messaging capabilities. TextDirect is an SMS-based navigation service that delivers step by step directions between two locations.
